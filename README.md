# Task Board challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a task board. This consists creating a board with three columns. One that is "To Do" one that is "In Progress" and one that is "Done" as well as a button to add tasks with a pop up form. I accomplished this with my js skills and bootstrap and jQuery that I have learned so far and have furthered my skills in all of these areas. 

## Installation

You can either just go to the website from the Github repository or via this [link](https://ben-jamin05.github.io/task-board-challenge/) or clone the code from the repository. 

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the website it should look something like [This](./assets/images/Screenshot%202024-05-02%20at%209.56.04â€¯PM.png). You will see a green button in the center of your screen. This is the button used to add tasks. Once you have filled out the form with the task title, date and description it will apear in the "To Do" column. You can drag the task card from column to column as you are completing the task. You may notice that if the project is 3 days or less to its due date the card will turn yellow, similarly if the task if past its due date it will turn red. You may delete tasks at anytime by clicking the red delete button.
